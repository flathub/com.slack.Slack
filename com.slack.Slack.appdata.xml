    <p>Slack offers chat rooms organized by topic, private groups,
    and direct messaging capabilities to facilitate conversation and help
    your team get things done. All content inside Slack is searchable,
    including files, conversations, and people, so it's easy to stay organized.
    Integration with several third-party services allows use of their
    features directly within your Slack discussions.</p>

     <release version="4.10.0" date="2020-10-08">
      <description>
        <p>Bug Fixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We fixed some issues that caused window resizing of Slack to be difficult. We never want to be difficult.</li>
          <li>Quickly switching workspaces caused problems. Switching workspaces should only cause opportunities, so we fixed that.</li>
          <li>There were a few little bugs that caused crashes, like bugs do. We fixed those, and we’ll fix the next ones too.</li>
        </ul>

     <release date="2020-09-17" version="4.9.1">
      <description>
        <p>Bug Fixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We tuned up the engine and gave the interiors a thorough clean. Everything is now running smoothly again.</li>
        </ul>

    </release>
     <release date="2020-07-20" version="4.8.0">
      <description>
        <p>Bug Fixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In rare cases, Slack would simply fail to start altogether. While we’re sure we could all use a coffee break, we know you could also use an application that runs. So we fixed that.</li>
          <li>We made the screen you see when you have connection problems more useful. We also spruced it up a bit with a fresh coat of paint.</li>
          <li>Our notifications system sprung a leak, so we brought it in for a tune-up. Everything should be running smoother now.</li>
        </ul>
      </description>
    </release>
     <release date="2020-07-03" version="4.7.0">
      <description>
        <p>What’s New:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A preference that allows you to choose a unique save location per download, instead of choosing a folder for all of them. For the choosy types.</li>
          <li>We’ve upgraded all the backend stuff that the apps run on, resulting in better performance and fewer bugs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>After restoring the app window, some parts of it could lose their clickiness. Those parts have found their clickiness anew. Click away. Clickety clickety click.</li>
          <li>If you found yourself, in some distant past, trying to start a song on Spotify with your keyboard’s play button, and it did not respond to your command while Slack was front and center, pesky hardware media keys were the problem. And this version is the cure.</li>
          <li>The app should be less spicy to your CPU when you’re viewing certain network error pages.</li>
          <li>When a download completes, we’ll show an in-app prompt rather than a bothersome system notification.</li>
        </ul>

    <release date="2020-05-18" version="4.4.3">
      <description>
        <p>Bug Fixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We’ve tinkered with the internal workings and polished some rough edges. The app is now better than it was.</li>
        </ul>

    </release>
    <release date="2020-03-31" version="4.4.2">
      <description>
        <p>Bug Fixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We're always working on performance improvements - and this release repairs a previously broken performance diagnostic tool. You won't notice a difference, but we'll have an easier time improving Slack.</li>
        </ul>

    <release date="2020-02-04" version="4.4.0">
      <description>
        <p>Bug Fixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed: If you zoom way in or zoom way out, and then open the About Slack window, the About Slack window would also be zoomed way in/out.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>What’s New:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We've tinkered with the internal workings and polished some rough edges. The app is now better than it was.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Slack would sometimes crash when the user right-clicked to see the context menu. In context, that was unhelpful. So it no longer does that.</li>
          <li>When maximized, the app had developed a bit of a distracting flicker. That flicker is now part of Slack history.</li>
          <li>Occasionally, a restart would result in connectivity issues for Slack… now you should be back online and back to work lickety-split. </li>
        </ul>

    </release>
    <release date="2019-10-08" version="4.1.1">
      <description>
        <p>What’s New</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Thanks to a few tweaks to the engine, a polish of the pistons, and recalibrated valves, the app should be running smoother and faster, than before.</li>
          <li>Spellcheck, revamped, is now a much better version of its old self (and back on Linux, to boot) — now it supports Greek, Portuguese and British English. So now spelling correctly should come more naturally to us all (which is good, because “correctly” can be a difacult word to spell). </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For a quicker connection, and less frustration, checking for network connectivity is more reliable than it was before. </li>
          <li>After uploading a video into Slack some found it would give an infinite circle of loading, but not play, which was never our plan. Now: it works! It plays; no more circle! Because, it turned out, all circ and no play made Slack a null ‘ploy.</li>
        </ul>

    <release date="2019-08-07" version="4.0.2">
      <description>
        <p>Bug Fixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Videos in channels were found to be the cause of a minor (but pesky) memory leak that has now been well and truly plugged.</li>
          <li>We spruced up the notifications a little so now they'll not only show up every time you need them to, they'll show up looking like whatever theme you wear proudly on your sidebar. Neat.</li>
          <li>On opening your computer, the app is now, thankfully, more likely to launch properly every time.</li>
          <li>If you'd become used to opening Slack from a shortcut on your desktop or menu… you'll know that we broke that recently. Sorry about that. It is now unbroken once more. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>What’s New:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Slack is now a little faster, thanks to a few small but important changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Drag and dropping files into Slack is now much more stable.</li>
          <li>If you ever do need to reset the app's data, it now works better. A bit better, at least.</li>
          <li>We improved team icons alignment in the side bar for those in a lot of workspaces. It's a small thing, but much more aesthetically pleasing.</li>
          <li>In a Cinnamon desktop environment, the Snap Slack app was missing a dock icon. We found it and put it back where it belongs. (In the dock.)</li>
          <li>Hardware acceleration can now be turned off without foregrounding Slack. If you know what that means, you'll know it's handy. If you don't — it still is! Carry on. And thank you for reading.</li>

      <description>
        <p>Bug Fixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Just as day follows night and winter gives way to spring, so have we updated Electron to 4.2.1</li>
          <li>The push notification time between desktop and mobile has been changed for the better</li>
          <li>Like stability? Us too. So we tweaked things, and now everything is more stable. In our app.</li>
          <li>We've updated the RPM icon dependency for a better availability &amp; icon experience. Because you're worth it.</li>

        <p>Bug Fixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Launch (and Hide) on Login have been improved and are now just … better.The new loading animation was a little stretched, or a little squished, depending on how you looked at it. It's now practically perfect.</li>
          <li>Pressing 'Control+Shift+V' would cause copied text to paste twice. We've fixed that.</li>
          <li>Pressing 'Control+Shift+V' would cause copied text to paste twice. We've fixed that. In Slack.</li>
          <li>Some teams were experiencing an issue where icons that belonged to other signed-in teams were showing up rather than their own. This was deeply confusing. Sorry about that.</li>
          <li>Unhelpful keyboard and cursor actions that some people were experiencing have now, thankfully, been fixed</li>

          <li>When you sign in, you'll now sign in through the browser rather than within the app</li>

          <li>Occasionally, the "Open the Slack App" browser button was not opening the workspace in the desktop app. Silly, really. It now does.</li>
          <li>If you use SSO (Single Sign-on) to log in, it should now work perfectly every time</li>

      <description>
        <p>What’s New:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>From today, you'll notice a shiny new app button that matches our new logo. You can read more about it on our blog at SlackHQ.com. Change! Everyone loves it. (Having said that, nothing about Slack or how you use it has changed. Just the button.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Users signing in with Single Sign-On would see the same message twice when logging in</li>
          <li>Users signing in with Single Sign-On would see the same message twice when logging in. This will not happen any more.</li>
          <li>When trying to select a portion of a code-formatted block of text (text formatted with ` or ``` at either end), some characters were proving slippery and hard to select. No more.</li>
          <li>The desktop app was not playing nicely with the glibc 2.28. If you were experiencing a segfault, you should segfault no more. It's better now.</li>
          <li>The full screen shortcut was mistakenly listed as ‘Ctrl+F’ instead of ‘Ctrl+Shift+F’ in the "View" menu. We both apologize for this and also hope that, because of it, someone out there discovered 'Ctrl+F' is a useful shortcut for searching the channel that you're in. Always look on the bright side of bugs.</li>

    <release date="2018-08-31" version="3.3.1">
      <description>
        <ul>
          <li>Overall, stability has been improved, thanks to a veritable bevy of bugfixes</li>
          <li>It's so very useful when you report issues that we've tweaked the diagnostics that collect reports so that we can get to them, and to things being better for you, sooner</li>
          <li>There was an annoying flickering caused by the color profiles having been updated in 3.2.0. There is, as far as we can tell, no more flicker.</li>
          <li>When you download something, we will now more dependably tell you so</li>
          <li>Duplicate windows were leading to dubious repetitious notifications if multiple instances of the aforementioned were open simultaneously. We've fixed them so that the overt duplicity of multiplicities no longer incurs incongruity. TL;DR: No more doublespeak. If you have multiple windows open, you'll now only be notified once. </li>
          <li>We’ve tinkered with the internal workings and polished some rough edges. The app is now better than it was.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>If you use Red Hat, you now have spell check. For other distros, you have a new and different spellchecker. Hopefully it is better at detecting what language you are writing in. Hopefully.</li>
