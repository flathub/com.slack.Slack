    <p>
      Caution: Slack for Linux is in beta. We’re still busy adding features and
      ironing out potential issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slack brings team communication and collaboration into one place so you
      can get more work done, whether you belong to a large enterprise or a
      small business. Check off your to-do list and move your projects forward
      by bringing the right people, conversations, tools, and information you
      need together. Slack is available on any device, so you can find and
      access your team and your work, whether you’re at your desk or on the go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scientifically proven (or at least rumored) to make your working life
      simpler, more pleasant, and more productive. We hope you’ll give Slack a
      try.

        <ul>
          <li>Hard work is happening this week, but nothing we can easily describe. It’s like a duck swimming on a pond. Under the water, the duck is paddling furiously, but on top all that can be seen is the gentle gliding of a bird on water. This week, Slack is the duck.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Intelligent quips often contain depth of thought, but that's not what we mean when we say that smartquotes were presenting a problem for deep links. Punctuation will no longer affect the punctuality of your deep link updates.</li>
          <li>Good governance is all about removing roadblocks, which is why we've retooled the sign-in flow for GovSlack. Now when you sign in to a government workspace for the first time, we'll automatically restart the app in Gov mode (instead of kicking you back to the login page). Your Slack dollars at work!</li>

        <p>What’s New</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You may have noticed that with this release there’s a new, larger number at the end of the version string. Going forward, while you’ll still see the numbers laid out in a [MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD] sequence, the “Build” numbers will now correspond to specific builds on our end as opposed to a small sequential number. TL;DR: A few more numbers for you, a bit more specificity for everyone.</li>
          <li>We’ve added the most common Apple and Microsoft file extensions to our approved list so you won’t be asked to confirm each time you open a Word doc or Keynote presentation. Are you sure you’d like one less approval? YES/NO</li>

        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you tried to re-download a file that was already present in your Downloads folder, the app would pretend to download it again without actually producing a new file. Duplicitous duplication was never part of the plan—sorry about that.</li>

        <p>What’s New</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Starting today, you’ll see a confirmation pop-up when a link in Slack is prompting another program to open. If you don’t want to see these each time because you enjoy living on the edge, just check the box “Always open files of this type.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We discovered that under very specific circumstances (stars being aligned, barometric pressure being just so, looking in a mirror and saying “Slackbot” 3 times), Active Directory users were ending up with a backslash in their Home directory, which was preventing the app from launching. However it happened, all slashes are welcome at the party, so Slack will run as expected now.</li>

        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Perhaps you wanted to know which version of the app you had installed. Maybe we gave you an option to copy that version number to your clipboard. It’s possible the “Copy” button did nothing at all. One might say we fixed it.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>If you are someone who moved your app data directory and were using a symlink, you may have noticed that Slack would fail to open beyond the initial launch. Well, now it won’t do that anymore. We fixed it, you see.</li>
          <li>Some external URLs were occasionally launching within the Slack app window, but will now load in your default web browser, as is proper. Slack cannot have a little web page, even as a treat.</li>

        <p>What’s New</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When opening SSH, FTP, SFTP or SMB links, you’ll now see the option to allow all future URLs from just that same domain instead of the whole wide world. A little more secure for us, a little more peace of mind for you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We fixed a crash that was occurring on certain Linux clients, as studies have shown that Slack works better when it doesn’t sporadically quit without warning.</li>
          <li>Certain versions of the app were not correctly changing availability to “Away” after 10 minutes of inactivity. While this has been fixed, we’d like to remind you that you can use your Custom Status to let your teammates know your whereabouts beyond simply Active or Away. Examples include: walking the dog, catching up after PTO, taking a mental break, or tweeting nice things to the Slack social media team.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>When you move or resize Slack, we assume you are indeed trying to move or resize it — and so the crash that was regularly happening, instead, was unwelcome. We’ve fixed this. Here’s to properly-sized screens!</li>
          <li>We’ve fixed several accessibility issues. Making Slack more accessible is a continuous journey, and we’re quite grateful that you’re along for the ride!</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A preference that allows you to choose a unique save location per download, instead of choosing a folder for all of them. For the choosy types.</li>
          <li>We’ve upgraded all the backend stuff that the apps run on, resulting in better performance and fewer bugs.</li>
          <li>Our spell checker has been swapped out for a newer model that’s faster, leaner, and capable of fixing your typos in… wait, can this be right? “Multiple languages at the same time”! Open the “Language &amp; Region” preferences to choose your languages. And for whoever it is out there requires that functionality: our hats are off to you. We can barely type in one language right now.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>After restoring the app window, some parts of it could lose their clickiness. Those parts have found their clickiness anew. Click away. Clickety clickety click.</li>
          <li>If you found yourself, in some distant past, trying to start a song on Spotify with your keyboard’s play button, and it did not respond to your command while Slack was front and center, pesky hardware media keys were the problem. And this version is the cure.</li>
          <li>The app should be less spicy to your CPU when you’re viewing certain network error pages.</li>
          <li>When a download completes, we’ll show an in-app prompt rather than a bothersome system notification.</li>

        <p>What’s New</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Our newest, fastest, best-performing, shiniest, most nutritious and delicious version of Slack is now fully rolled out, so that’s the one you’re now using. Brilliant.</li>
          <li>Like zooming in and out? Use a numpad? Great news. You can now do these things, on that.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Notifications looked weird if your workspace name was long. Now, no matter your team name, notifications look lovely.</li>
          <li>Some messages were being marked as read when Slack was hidden behind applications, or not visible on screen. Now we won’t mark it as read until you’ve actually seen it. Which seems fair.</li>
          <li>In Linux some components of the app were displaying menus when menus were not required. These items are now officially off-menu. Or rather, the menu is now officially off-them.</li>
          <li>By popular demand (and because it was a bug), the --silent option is now available to silence terminal output.</li>

        <p>What’s New</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Thanks to a few tweaks to the engine, a polish of the pistons, and recalibrated valves, the app should be running smoother and faster, than before.</li>
          <li>Spellcheck, revamped, is now a much better version of its old self (and back on Linux, to boot) — now it supports Greek, Portuguese and British English. So now spelling correctly should come more naturally to us all (which is good, because “correctly” can be a difacult word to spell).</li>

        <ul>
          <li>For a quicker connection, and less frustration, checking for network connectivity is more reliable than it was before.</li>
          <li>After uploading a video into Slack some found it would give an infinite circle of loading, but not play, which was never our plan. Now: it works! It plays; no more circle! Because, it turned out, all circ and no play made Slack a null ‘ploy.</li>

        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Videos in channels were found to be the cause of a minor (but pesky) memory leak that has now been well and truly plugged.</li>
          <li>We spruced up the notifications a little so now they'll not only show up every time you need them to, they'll show up looking like whatever theme you wear proudly on your sidebar. Neat.</li>
          <li>On opening your computer, the app is now, thankfully, more likely to launch properly every time.</li>
          <li>If you'd become used to opening Slack from a shortcut on your desktop or menu… you'll know that we broke that recently. Sorry about that. It is now unbroken once more.</li>

        <p>What’s New</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Slack is now a little faster, thanks to a few small but important changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Drag and dropping files into Slack is now much more stable.</li>
          <li>If you ever do need to reset the app's data, it now works better. A bit better, at least.</li>
          <li>We improved team icons alignment in the side bar for those in a lot of workspaces. It's a small thing, but much more aesthetically pleasing.</li>
          <li>In a Cinnamon desktop environment, the Snap Slack app was missing a dock icon. We found it and put it back where it belongs. (In the dock.)</li>
          <li>Hardware acceleration can now be turned off without foregrounding Slack. If you know what that means, you'll know it's handy. If you don't — it still is! Carry on. And thank you for reading.</li>

      <description>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Just as day follows night and winter gives way to spring, so have we updated Electron to 4.2.1</li>
          <li>The push notification time between desktop and mobile has been changed for the better</li>
          <li>Like stability? Us too. So we tweaked things, and now everything is more stable. In our app.</li>
          <li>We've updated the RPM icon dependency for a better availability &amp; icon experience. Because you're worth it.</li>

        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Launch (and Hide) on Login have been improved and are now just … better.The new loading animation was a little stretched, or a little squished, depending on how you looked at it. It's now practically perfect.</li>
          <li>Pressing 'Control+Shift+V' would cause copied text to paste twice. We've fixed that.</li>
          <li>Pressing 'Control+Shift+V' would cause copied text to paste twice. We've fixed that. In Slack.</li>
          <li>Some teams were experiencing an issue where icons that belonged to other signed-in teams were showing up rather than their own. This was deeply confusing. Sorry about that.</li>
          <li>Unhelpful keyboard and cursor actions that some people were experiencing have now, thankfully, been fixed</li>

        <p>What’s New</p>

          <li>When you sign in, you'll now sign in through the browser rather than within the app</li>

          <li>Occasionally, the "Open the Slack App" browser button was not opening the workspace in the desktop app. Silly, really. It now does.</li>
          <li>If you use SSO (Single Sign-on) to log in, it should now work perfectly every time</li>

      <description>
        <p>What’s New</p>
        <ul>
          <li>From today, you'll notice a shiny new app button that matches our new logo. You can read more about it on our blog at SlackHQ.com. Change! Everyone loves it. (Having said that, nothing about Slack or how you use it has changed. Just the button.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Users signing in with Single Sign-On would see the same message twice when logging in</li>
          <li>Users signing in with Single Sign-On would see the same message twice when logging in. This will not happen any more.</li>
          <li>When trying to select a portion of a code-formatted block of text (text formatted with ` or ``` at either end), some characters were proving slippery and hard to select. No more.</li>
          <li>The desktop app was not playing nicely with the glibc 2.28. If you were experiencing a segfault, you should segfault no more. It's better now.</li>
          <li>The full screen shortcut was mistakenly listed as ‘Ctrl+F’ instead of ‘Ctrl+Shift+F’ in the "View" menu. We both apologize for this and also hope that, because of it, someone out there discovered 'Ctrl+F' is a useful shortcut for searching the channel that you're in. Always look on the bright side of bugs.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Overall, stability has been improved, thanks to a veritable bevy of bugfixes</li>
          <li>It's so very useful when you report issues that we've tweaked the diagnostics that collect reports so that we can get to them, and to things being better for you, sooner</li>
          <li>There was an annoying flickering caused by the color profiles having been updated in 3.2.0. There is, as far as we can tell, no more flicker.</li>
          <li>When you download something, we will now more dependably tell you so</li>
          <li>Duplicate windows were leading to dubious repetitious notifications if multiple instances of the aforementioned were open simultaneously. We've fixed them so that the overt duplicity of multiplicities no longer incurs incongruity. TL;DR: No more doublespeak. If you have multiple windows open, you'll now only be notified once. </li>
          <li>We’ve tinkered with the internal workings and polished some rough edges. The app is now better than it was.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>If you use Red Hat, you now have spell check. For other distros, you have a new and different spellchecker. Hopefully it is better at detecting what language you are writing in. Hopefully.</li>
